# AI-Final-Project
The purpose of this project was to classify the sexes of certain species of abalone. To do this, the data needed to be grabbed and the environment needed to be setup. Next models were compared and based on the comparisons, the models would be created. The models that were created were: Decision Tree Classifier, KNN Classifier, and Logistic regression Classifier models. Next the models were tuned and plotted, and my predicted sexes were off from the actual sexes. Looking at the results, for the prediction of males the number of true male predictions was higher than the other sexes, for the prediction of Infants the true number of infants was surprisingly accurate, and finally for the prediction of females the true number of females was lower than the predicted male(but was actually female).
